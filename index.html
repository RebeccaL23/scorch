			<h2>HELLO.</h2>
			<div id='about2'>

			<p>My name is Rebecca, I was born in Malaysia (02/10/1994) where I attended the same international school ever since I can remember. I had the same lovely group of friends and I had a happy, comfortable childhood.</p>
			<p>At the age of 16, I decided to pack my bags and head to Geelong, Australia for boarding school (and no, it wasn't a punishment from my parents...but for a while it certainly did feel like one). All the consistencies in my life-my friends, family, school, culture, my home-became the inconsistencies. It was tough but ended up being one of the best decisions of my life.
			<p>At Geelong, I completed the International Baccalaureate and partook in numerous co-curricular activities, including a homework club for Karen refugees, and sustainability and human welfare societies. I also took up sailing, where I was (literally) thrown into the deep end, and eventually sailed on to participate and win in some competitions. Throughout my entire schooling life, I've loved and been active in music - I was a member of the choir, a jazz band (I played the piano, vibraphones & sang; although I wouldn't wish my singing on anybody else now), the Senior School Band (on the flute), elected as House Music Co-Captain and have completed my grade 8 LCM piano examinations as well.</p>
			<p>I loved Melbourne so much I decided to continue studying here and in Dec 2015, I completed my Bachelor's of Commerce with majors in Finance and Management. I was a member of the surf club, even though my surfing skills wouldn't make you think so, and spent time tutoring less fortunate kids in an external program called the Operational Stitches Homework Club.</p>
			<br>
			<span id='now'>Now? I am embarking on my career journey - and hopefully Scorch is my next stop.</span>

	<div id='section2'>
		<div class='section2text' id='section21'>I've had the opportunity to work in both a corporate (large investment bank, Malaysia) & startup (web-based startup team of six, Richmond) setting, where I experimented with various technologies-from the Bloomberg Terminal to Google Products, such as Adwords. I've also honed my web-development and social media skills through my side project, <a href='http://repleat.co/' id='link'/><i>Repleat</i></a>; an independent bag label started by the women of my family. I also manage the Facebook & Instagram for a Malaysian residential community brand, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/GitaBayuMY/'><i>Gita Bayu.</i></a></div>
		<div class='section2text' id='section22'>My average score of Second Class Honours Division A for my Management major in my third year is a testament to this; assessments were primarily group-based essays or reports, demonstrating my ability to transfer ideas eloquently, to both people and paper.</div>
		<div class='section2text' id='section23'>My interests in the startup arena are newly discovered, but have since blossomed following my recent experiences at a startup, my GA course, and my side projects (Repleat & Gita Bayu). I'm also especially intrigued by the digital space, as I recognise the growing influence of social media and the Internet; I've attended a few classes at General Assembly, an entrepreneurship course (run by YPO), completed an online User Experience course (by David Travis) and currently doing the Google Analytics Academy in my own time.</div>
		<div class='section2text' id='section24'>My experiences thus far, such as through my numerate Commerce degree in which I frequently analysed and presented inferences drawn from statistics & my internship at an investment bank, have groomed my ability to think both logically and analytically.<br> I also partook in a front-end web development course (HTML / CSS / JavaScript & jQuery) at General Assembly; while most classmates opted to build a personal portfolio website, I built an interactive origami website that received a final score of 22/23. I adapted my solution from a simple card flip animation, yet ultimately presented my own original code of origami folding animations.</div>

						<div id='growth'>
							<b>Growth.</b> I am looking for an opportunity to further my growth, both as an individual and as part of a team, and I believe Scorch is the perfect place to kickstart my career journey. I have already begun to delve into my interests in the digital space, by maintaining and managing the various social media platforms representing a Malaysian residential community, Gita Bayu, and by attending a Front-end Web Development course (plus some other miscellaneous, digital one-off workshops) at General Assembly. I am continuing to hone my web development skills through developing the website for a bag label (Repleat) founded by the women in my family. Along the journey of establishing Repleat, I've learnt a lot, spanning the discovery of the intricacies of social media from a business' perspective, to different marketing outreach platforms and ways. Yet, I know I have much to learn, and what better way than to do so from professionals and experts within the digital space. The clientele and reputation of Scorch is enough to convey the impressive calibre of resources and employees, which will no doubt prove advantageous in my growth and learning, as well as expose me to a range of different businesses and industries, ensuring no two days are the same.

						<div class='c' id='c1'>Culture.</div>
						<div id='culture'>
							<b>Culture.</b>Having experienced working in both a startup and investment bank, the two juxtaposing cultures and ways of working has made me realise and appreciate the impact culture has on productivity and satisfaction. As a digital agency, I believe Scorch perfectly straddles my two internship environments, with a casual and warm environment thats apt for collaboration, combined with the successful ways of working and functions derived from being more established than a startup. I'd love to work within an environment that facilitates growth not only technically and professionally, but also socially, which then encourages the line between work life and personal life to be blurred and makes it easier for one to invest more time and effort into both.

							<p class='back'>BACK</p>
						</div>
						<div class='c' id='c2'>Challenge.</div><div id='challenge'>
							<b>Challenge.</b> I'm excited (and nervous!) about starting on my career journey, and am also always up for a challenge. Stepping into a new, and my first, permanent role within a new environment, with new people and a new structure will no doubt be challenging. Specifically, liaising and consulting clients and getting up to speed with Search Marketing will be challenging considering my limited experience in both. Still, I am no stranger to working under pressure, as university has taught me, and being placed out of my comfort zone-having moved independently at the age of sixteen-and I am certain I will thrive in environments that consistently push me.
